I'm a software developer but, first of all, fan and supporter of everything turns around computer science, security and open source.
I'm very enthusiastic of Python language which became my first choice during implementation phase of a project.

Even if Java was my old used language, I've never completely abandoned it and, nowadays, I used it during Android application development.
My passions for programming, led me to take part as an active user on many association like LUG and GDG.
