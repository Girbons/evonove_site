Currently I am a Java and Python developer and software marketer at the IT company I founded in Perugia with a my friend in 2010, Evonove. Evonove was a new start point, changing my way to look at IT world completely.
We make little jewels, shining and functional: to make people happy.

I founded Python User Group of Perugia. There, I met wonderful people, who share with me passion on IT. Now they work with me in Evonove.
I have a degree in Computer Engineering, but that was many years ago. Now I'm a simple Executive Chef in Evonove :)
